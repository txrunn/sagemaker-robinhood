# Options Trading Bot using AWS Sagemaker and Robinhood API

This project involves creating an options trading bot for Apple Inc. stocks using AWS Sagemaker and Robinhood API. The bot uses sentiment analysis and historical stock trends for predictive modeling and trades options based on these predictions. The infrastructure is designed following the AWS Well-Architected Framework principles.

## Project Structure

This project has the following structure:

- `cloudformation/templates`: For CloudFormation templates to automate infrastructure provisioning.
- `data`: For storing data.
- `models`: For storing trained models or model artifacts.
- `notebooks`: For any Jupyter notebooks.
- `scripts`: Scripts for data collection, processing, and trading.
- `src`: Source code for the project. Divided into `data`, `models`, and `trading`.
- `tests`: For any test scripts.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies required to run the project.

## Architecture

The architecture for this project follows AWS best practices:

1. Data Collection: Python scripts on an EC2 instance collect data from APIs and store it in S3.
2. Data Processing and Model Training: Sagemaker notebook instances are used for data analysis, model development and training. Processed data and model artifacts are stored in S3.
3. Model Deployment: The model is deployed on a Sagemaker endpoint.
4. Trading: A script uses the Sagemaker endpoint to get predictions and the Robinhood API to execute options trades.
5. Monitoring: AWS CloudWatch is used for monitoring, alerting, and logging.
6. CI/CD: AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild are used for the CI/CD pipeline, which automatically deploys code changes to Sagemaker and other scripts.
7. Infrastructure Management: AWS CloudFormation is used for creating and managing AWS resources.
